### Auto-correct

- In auto-correct mode, RuboCop will try to automatically fix offenses:

`$ rubocop -A`

# or

`$ rubocop --auto-correct-all`

- There are a couple of things to keep in mind about auto-correct:

-For some offenses, it is not possible to implement automatic correction.

Some automatic corrections that are possible have not been implemented yet.

- Some automatic corrections might change (slightly) the semantics of the code, meaning they‚Äôd produce code that‚Äôs mostly equivalent to the original code, but not 100% equivalent. We call such auto-correct behavior "unsafe".
